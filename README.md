## Major Libraries Used

### 1. Retrofit

Retrofit is a network library that is used to fetch and send the data from/to server. There are other network libraries such as Volley but I prefer Retrofit due to it's performance and ease of usability.

It manages the process of receiving, sending, and creating HTTP requests and responses.

### 2. Glide

One of the few disadvantages of Retrofit is that it does not support image loading. It requires other libraries such as Glide and Picasso. So, we are using Glide in our project.

Glide is a fast and efficient image loading library for Android focused on smooth scrolling. Glide offers an easy to use API, a performant and extensible resource decoding pipeline and automatic resource pooling.

Glide supports fetching, decoding, and displaying video stills, images, and animated GIFs.
